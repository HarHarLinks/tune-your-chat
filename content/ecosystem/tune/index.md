I started to host Matrix to own the chat rooms with my friends with modern UX and features while also getting nice tech with e2ee and hackability through being an open protocol etc.

At first, the chat experience was enhanced using bots providing useful services, quickly followed by shitposting bots and similar fun stuff.
From there, I expanded my personal setup with utilities such as reminder bot.
As I started hosting more and more services for myself and my community, a need for notifications about things arose.
